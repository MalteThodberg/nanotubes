# Data and citation

The `nanotubes` packages contains CAGE data from the paper "Identification of Gene Transcription Start Sites and Enhancers Responding to Pulmonary Carbon Nanotube Exposure in Vivo" (https://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/acsnano.6b07533). Data is provided as CAGE Transcription Start Sites (CTSSs) stored as BigWig-files, along with the study design.

If you use nanotubes, please cite the following article:

```{r citation, eval=TRUE}
citation("nanotubes")
```

# Installation

You can install the development version directly from GitHub using `devtools`:

```{r github, eval=FALSE}
